# Case-Study-on-Classification-problem
Problem Statement:
Subsidy Inc. delivers subsidies to individuals based on their income. Accurate income data is one of the hardest piece of data to obtain across the world. Subsidy Inc. has obtained a large data set of authenticated data on individual income, demographic parameters, and a few financial parameters. The objective is to simplify the data system by reducing the number of variables to be studies, without sacrificing too much of accuracy. 


The data was studied and understood using the python.
Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm was used in this case study.
Both of these algorithms gives more or less the same performance in terms of accuracy and misclassified samples.
